Problem 2: Croquembouche
You are designing a delicious croquembouche (a French dessert composed of a cone-shaped tower of cream puffs ðŸ˜‹), for a couple's wedding. They want the cream puffs to have a variety of flavors. You've finished your design and want to send it to the couple for review.

Given a root of a binary tree design where each node in the tree represents a cream puff in the croquembouche, that prints a list of the flavors (vals) of each cream puff in level order (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

Note: The build_tree() and print_tree() functions both use variations of a level order traversal. To get the most out of this problem, we recommend that you reference these functions as little as possible while implementing your solution.

Evaluate the time complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity. Assume the input tree is balanced when calculating time complexity.

class Puff():
     def __init__(self, flavor, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = flavor
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def print_design(design):
    pass
Example Usage:

"""
            Vanilla
           /       \
      Chocolate   Strawberry
      /     \
  Vanilla   Matcha  
"""
croquembouche = Puff("Vanilla", 
                    Puff("Chocolate", Puff("Vanilla"), Puff("Matcha")), 
                    Puff("Strawberry"))
print_design(croquembouche)
Example Output:

['Vanilla', 'Chocolate', 'Strawberry', 'Vanilla', 'Matcha']

# Understand: Print a list of each val in level order

# Plan: Create a res list to store output, use a deque to iterate through each node

# This solution is O(n) because we are traversing each node once and storing the values in a list. We are using a queue to keep track of the nodes at each level, and we are appending the values to the list in a single pass.
