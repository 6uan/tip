Problem 9: Merging Missions II
Below is an iterative solution to the merge_missions() function from the previous problem. Compare your recursive solution to the iterative solution below.

Discuss with your podmates. Which solution do you prefer?

class Node:
    def __init__(self, value=0, next=None):
        self.value = value
        self.next = next

# For testing
def print_linked_list(head):
    current = head
    while current:
        print(current.value, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next

def merge_missions_iterative(mission1, mission2):
    temp = Node()  # Temporary node to simplify the merging process
    tail = temp

    while mission1 and mission2:
        if mission1.value < mission2.value:
            tail.next = mission1
            mission1 = mission1.next
        else:
            tail.next = mission2
            mission2 = mission2.next
        tail = tail.next

    # Attach the remaining nodes, if any
    if mission1:
        tail.next = mission1
    elif mission2:
        tail.next = mission2

    return temp.next  # Return the head of the merged linked list
